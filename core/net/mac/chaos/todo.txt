		join
			* merge
			* why do we schedule join so often?
				change pending logic: maybe add current round id to pending question: apps can decide whether it would like to be scheduled once more	
		max
		
		glossy
		
		
		go thourgh all field in the chaos header and make sure they are
			merges correltly
			initialzed?
		
		performance issues
		
				
		track energy consumption
		
		also: how can apps do logging?

		
		move the defines that the user should set to special place
			node count, slot length, max slot count, packet size
	 	glossy like app
	 		check
	 		use for testing: do we get a performance like Glossy paper
		apps
			need a three phase process for "real" apps
				if not synced: do a glossy like forwarding
				once synced: do join
				once joined: do real app
				for this: implement sync flag	 
		add node id to tx
		tx policy
		scheduler

		Fix: wait until getting first valid packet before starting slotted behavior (so it corrects for desync. Otherwise, we may lose the first packet)
		
		channel hopping
			later: we should add an extension so we can collect information about bad channels and agree on which ones we blacklist
		security (sign, crypt)
			check processing time for sign and verify sign: constant?
			check processing time for encrypt and decrypt: constant?
			check: what does the bluetooth platform support here -> so that we know
		porting + platform abstraction?
